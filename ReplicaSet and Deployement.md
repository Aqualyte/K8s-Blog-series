Replicaset ensures that specified number of pods should be running in the cluster. Its purpose is to maintain the specified number of pods and prevent the user from loosing the control of the application incase of any pod failure or inaccessible. Whenever any pod gets failed replicaset immidiatly launces another pod and replacing it with terminated pod.
